# Vengeance
The **New** Ultimate Bookmarklet!

An addon to [Avo](https://github.com/FogNetwork/Avo) and the successor to [avo-ultimate](https://github.com/Browncha023/avo-ultimate)

A new favlet featuring unblocked dev tools, games, and more!

## Installation & Updating
1. Show your bookmarks bar with `ctrl + shift + b`

2. Right click on the bar and choose `Add Page` (If you're updating right click your old bookmark and select `Edit`)

3. Set the name to `Vengeance` and the URL to the code below:

```js
javascript:(function () {var v = document.createElement('script');v.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Browncha023/Vengeance@v1.0.0/script.min.js';document.body.appendChild(v);}())
```

### Features
- Unblocked dev tools including an improved edit function
- A game hub featuring 8 fun games to mess around with
- Several different other functions to utilize
- An update function and future update roadmap
- Can't be blocked by the school by using several different tactics
- And a revamped UI

### Troubleshooting
- First of all, bookmarlets are not supported on all sites
- Second of all, the bookmarklet may appear slightly different on certain sites due to CSS rules
- If the bookmarklet is not working on any sites and you are part of `Alpine School District`, it means that the IT team has somehow figured out a new way to block it. If so, come back here and new code should be ready, if not wait a little while and come back. The README will confirm that there is new code
- If you have a problem with something else such as the games not working anywhere, contact me @ browncha023@alpinsd.org (For `Alpine School District`) or @ cjbrown402@gmail.com (For `Other`)

#### Update Roadmap:
- vGBA (Coming 2.0+)
- Rewrite Main Source (Coming 3.0+)

**Roadmap subject to change!*
